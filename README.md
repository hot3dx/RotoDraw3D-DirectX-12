This really is close to finished the only things left to go are to hook up a few 
of the UI Xaml features, finish adding the Sculpt Feature, Save Files to other formats like fbx, dae, obj, sdkmesh2,
and whatever else we can think up like XBox

Oh yes there are no help files yet but everything is numbered by steps

only draws one single object! Which would be meant to transfer to a scene editor

Currently only uses, ,dds files for textures
